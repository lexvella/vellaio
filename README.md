This is just me playing around in Spacemacs.
I just learned how to SPC-Move Windows. Escape to clear the mode, then space, then number.
I'm going to move to window 3 next.

Watching the cursor move around is kind of cool, I guess.

And there, now I'm on window three.
It's kind of a weird setup given that I also have to learn to use the Spacemacs addon Magit at the same time, which does funny things to window layouts.
